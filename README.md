# ReadMe-Generator

## Description

A CLI application that generates a README.md file for the user using answers given by the user. When run using a CLI the application will ask the user questions through the CLI using inquirer. These questions will ask for information about the project and create a README.md file in the output folder once all the questions have been answered.

## Installation

This application will require the user to install dependencies. To install these dependencies the user will need Node.js and can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

To use the application the user will need to go the folder navigate to the folder location on their device in their CLI and then follow the steps outlined in the [Installation section](#installation) to install the required dependencies. Once that has been done the application can be run by running the command:
```
node index.js
```
Once run the application will ask the user questions through the CLI, answer the questions accordingly and once all the questions have been answered the application will create a README.md file for the user, using the answers given, in the output folder.
